# Async/Await

---

## The short story

---

```clike
// fire and forget
interface IOperation
{
  Task Fire();
}

// some consumer code
IOperation operation;

void MyCoolCode(IOperation operation)
{
  operation.Fire();
}
----
* > Consuming Task based methods
```

---

```csharp
warning CS4014: Because this call is not awaited,
execution of the current method continues before the
call is completed. Consider applying the 'await'
operator to the result of the call.
----
* > Treat warnings as errors
```

---

```clike
// fire and forget
interface IOperation
{
  Task Fire();
}

// some consumer code
IOperation operation;

async void MyCoolCode(IOperation operation)
{
  await operation.Fire();
}
----
* > Fixing our code
12 > Adding await
10 > Making the function async
```

---

## Remember

- Add both `async` and `await`
- `void` can stay `void` -> we call this fire and forget
- `void` can become `Task` -> our caller can `await` us
- `ReturnType` becomes `Task<ReturnType>`

---

```clike
async Task DoStuff(CancellationToken token)
{
  await ...
  token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();

  for ()
  {
    await ...
    token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
  }
}
----
* > Always check cancellation!
```

---

```clike
try
{
  await...
}
catch (OperationCancelledException)
{
  // cancelled
}
catch
{
  // errored!
}
* >
```

---

## Keep in mind

- `async` is infectious - convert all callers and their callers until the root
- Always `try-catch` in the `void` root

## Asynchronous Programming Model

- `Begin`/`End` pair of methods
- Consumes thread -> thread pool starvation
- Alternative is to poll the result for `IsCompleted`
- Doesn't compose well with other language constructs
- Impossible to orchestrate
- Read more at [Asynchronous Programming Model (APM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/asynchronous-programming-model-apm)

---

```clike
using (var file = File.Create("out.txt"))
{
    var bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("hello world");

    file.BeginWrite(bytes, 0, bytes.Length, ar =>
    {
        file.EndWrite(ar);
    }, null);
}
----
* > This doesn't work!
```

---

```clike
// write them in exact order!
foreach (var fileName in fileNames)
{
    var bytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("hello world");

    file.BeginWrite(bytes, 0, bytes.Length, ar =>
    {
        file.EndWrite(ar);
    }, null);
}

```clike
var client = new WebClient();

client.DownloadStringAsync(new Uri("https://e-conomic.com"));
client.DownloadStringCompleted += Client_DownloadStringCompleted;

private void Client_DownloadStringCompleted(
  object sender,
  DownloadStringCompletedEventArgs e)
{
    var html = e.Result;
}
----
* > Events!
3 > Initiate the async call
4 > Subscribe for the result with delegate
10 > Get the result later on the calling thread
* > But when do you remove the event?
```

## Event-based Asynchronous Pattern

- More modern
- Doesn't consume threads
- Allows multiple listeners
- Returns on the original thread
- Still doesn't compose
- If the owner of waiting wants to be async, must implement similar interface
- Read more at [Event-based Asynchronous Pattern (EAP)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/)

---

## Is there something better?

- We want easy to use interface
- Writing owners of async operation should also be easy to do
- Cancellation should be easy to use
- Progress reporting should be easy to do
- Should compose well with C# constructs

---

# Task Parallel Library - functional programming to the rescue!

<small>2010</small>

---

```clike
var task = GetMeSomeTask();

task.ContinueWith(t =>
{
  var result = t.Result;
});
----
* > New async pattern
1 > A hot task is acquired from somewhere
3 > A continuation is scheduled to run once it is completed.
```

---

```clike
var client = new WebClient();

var task = client.DownloadStringTaskAsync(...);
task.ContinueWith(t =>
{
    var html = t.Result;
});
----
* > Switching from EAP to TPL
```

---

# Is this really better?

<small>Spoiler: it is!</small>

---

```clike
var client = new WebClient();

Task<string> task = client.DownloadStringTaskAsync(...);
Task<int> length = task.ContinueWith(t =>
{
    var html = t.Result;

    return html.Length;
});
----
* > Tasks are a consistent interface
3 > This task returns some string
4 > This task returns some integer
```

---

```clike
var client = new WebClient();

var task = client.DownloadStringTaskAsync(...);
return task
  .ContinueWith(t =>
  {
      var html = t.Result;

      return html.Length;
  })
  .ContinueWith(t =>
  {
    var length = t.Result;

    // be creative here
  });
----
* > It is easy to chain them
5 > Continue when done
11 > Continue again...
* > And async "owner" becomes Task based as well
```

---

```clike
var promise = getData()
  .then(onSuccess)
  .catch(onFail);
----
* > Promises are tasks
```

---

- to cancel throw `OperationCancelledException`
- one can schedule to run on success, failure, cancellation or any combo
- one can schedule to run on any thread or on the UI thread

---

## What is a `Task`?

- a `Task` represents an ongoing operation (but it may already be when you get it)
- continuations are used to subscribe to the result
- subscribing after it is finished immediately invokes the continuation
- same for cancelled/faulted tasks
- IO bound and CPU bound operations

---

## Hmmm...

- We still haven't solved all of the problems
- Hard to compose with C# constructs
- We are introducing `CancellationToken` - cooperative cancellation
- For progress use `IProgress<T>` - manual work, but still...

---

# OK, let's do it manually!

---

```clike
public class Downloader : IDisposable
{
    private HttpClient client;

    public Downloader()
    {
        this.client = new HttpClient();
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        client.Dispose();
    }

    public Task<string> Fetcher(string subpath,
               CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        return client.GetStringAsync("baseUri" + subpath)
            .ContinueWith(t =>
            {
                cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
                return t.Result;
            });
    }
}
----
* > Wrapper manages C# constructs
1 > Must implement IDisposable because inner component uses it
3 > Remember state...
10,12 > ...so you can manually dispose it
16 > Use cooperative cancellation...
21 > ...but still manually check!
```

---

```clike
// Challenge! Convert to async

public static void Copy(Stream a, Stream b)
{
    var bytes = new byte[32];
    var offset = 0;
    int count;

    while ((count = a.Read(bytes, offset, 32)) > 0)
    {
        b.Write(bytes, offset, count);
        offset += count;
    }
}
----
* > Simple sync code
```

---

- we could rewrite it to async - but it's hard
- lot's of variables, state
- potential bugs
- non-obvious
- is anyone good at rewriting code?

---

```clike
public Task DoAsync()
{
  // some code
  int i = 0;
  task
    .ContinueWith(t =>
    {
      // some code that uses result...
      i = 1;
    })
    .ContinueWith(t =>
    {
      // some code that uses second result...
      i = -1;
    });
}
----
* > Hmmmm
```

---

```clike
public Task DoAsync()
{
  // some code
  int i = 0;
  var result1 <== task;

  // some code that uses result...
  i = 1;

  var result2 <== task2;
  // some code that uses second result...
  i = -1;
}
----
* > Assuming happy flow
5,10 > Can we ... make this happen?
5,10 > Can we ... wait for it?
5,10 > ...asynchronously?
```

---

```clike
public async Task DoAsync()
{
  // some code
  int i = 0;
  var result1 = await task;

  // some code that uses result...
  i = 1;

  var result2 = await task2;
  // some code that uses second result...
  i = -1;
}
----
* > That was easy!
5,10 > What exactly happens here? It's magic!
```

---

- `async` function is a state machine, but better than hand-written one
- it forces the method to return `void`, `Task` or `Task<T>`
- and now it is composable with C#
- cannot be used inside `unsafe`, `lock` and constructors

---

# Myth busting

- Async != parallel
- Async != threads
- Async means not-sync

---

# What's next?

- `ConfigureAwait(false)`
- Exception handling
- Combinators

---

> `await` saves current thread by default!

- required by UI applications
- wastes threads in ASP.NET workloads and in non-UI scenarios
- `ConfigureAwait(false)` tells the app to _not_ remember the thread
- not needed in ASP.NET Core
- Read more [AspNetCoreDiagnosticScenarios](https://github.com/davidfowl/AspNetCoreDiagnosticScenarios/blob/master/AsyncGuidance.md)
- use it always or never; if you aren't writing libraries, don't bother

---

```clike
// I don't care about thread
async Task Foo() => await Inner().ConfigureAwait(false);

// I don't care, but forgot to tell that!
async Task Inner() => await DeepCall();

// library also doesn't care about thread
async Task DeepCall() => await WeMustGoDeeper().ConfigureAwait(false);
----
* > Why all participants need to use it
1,2 > At the beginning we don't care
4,5 > But someone does!
7,8 > Even if inner code is correct!
```

---

# Exceptions are saved in Tasks

- `void` root handlers should _always_ catch!
- otherwise `TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException` will be invoked which won't crash your app since .NET 4.5 (but you can change it)
- awaiting already faulted `Task` immediately throws the inner exception.

---

# CPU bound stuff

- When dealing with heavy CPU operations use `Task.Run`
- Better than background worker or threads for short-lived code
- Freely mix fake tasks, IO bound tasks and CPU bound tasks
- Read more [Task.Run vs Task.Factory.StartNew](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/pfxteam/task-run-vs-task-factory-startnew/)

---

```clike
var result = await Task.Run(AnalyzeData);
----
* > Run heavy code...
```

---

```clike
var result = await Task.Run(async () =>
{
    await Task.Delay(0);
    return 1;
});

var result = await Task.Factory.StartNew(async () =>
{
    await Task.Delay(0);
    return 1;
}).Unwrap();
```

---

# DEMO fake task

---

## Combinators

- `Task.WhenAll` and `Task.WhenAny`
- latter is useful for timeout

---

```clike
public static Task<T> WithTimeout<T>(this Task<T> task, int timeout)
{
    var t = Task.Delay(timeout);

    var first = Task.WhenAny(task, t);

    if (first == t)
        throw new Exception();

    return Task.FromResult(task.Result);
}
----
* > Generic extension method on all tasks!
5 > We wait for first one to finish
8 > Not the best way...maybe cancel the other task?
10 > Useful helper!
```

---

# HACK HACK HACK

- We can force `async` operation to finish synchronously by calling `.Result`, `.Wait()` or preferably `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()`.
- But please don't! Only for legacy code where rewriting the entire stack is dangerous
- In certain cases this might deadlock

---

# sync vs async

|      | sync                 | async                |     |     |
| ---- | -------------------- | -------------------- | --- | --- |
| one  | T                    | Task&lt;T&gt;        |     |     |
| many | IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; | IObservable&lt;T&gt; |     |     |

- Rx = LINQ to events
- if `Task` gives one result `IObservable` gives many

```clike
private async void Button_Click_3(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
    var client = new HttpClient();
    await client.GetStringAsync("https://secure.e-conomic.com");

Task throttle = null;

{
    if (throttle != null)
    {
        cts.Cancel();
    };

    cts = new CancellationTokenSource();

    throttle = Task.Delay(500, cts.Token);
    throttle.ContinueWith(
      t => Download(),
      TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnRanToCompletion);
}

async Task Download()
{
    var client = new HttpClient();
    await client.GetStringAsync("https://secure.e-conomic.com");
}
----
* > Complicated, but can be made as a higher order operation
2 > We need to cancel previous request
6,7,8,9 > Cancel if not first
13 > Throttle by 500 ms
14,15,16 > Only if throttle wasn't cancelled do the operation
* > Use Rx if this is needed
```

# IAsyncEnumerable

- `for` and `await` are opaque -> they become `Task<TResult>`
- but maybe the consumer _also_ want's to `for-await`

---

```clike
Task<IEnumerable<T>> list;

foreach (var element in await list)
{
  // only runs once everything is retrieved!
}
----
* > How to do SelectAsync

static async Task Main(string[] args)
{
    await foreach (var html in Downloader(
      "http://e-conomic.com",
      "http://secure.e-conomic.com"))
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"HTML: {html.Substring(0, 10)}");
